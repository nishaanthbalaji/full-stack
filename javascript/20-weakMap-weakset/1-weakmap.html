      // in case of strong if i delete a data stored in map n set it will be permanentaly deleted from memory i cant recover that
      // in case of weak if i delete a data stored in week map n set it will be moved to a garbage located in memory  i can recover from that garbage whenever i want that

      // week not really important just to know the concept
